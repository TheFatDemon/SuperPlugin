> You will never win if you never begin

### Why

Decided to start working on Clashnia again. This time I'm going to be putting my skills to the test and see how much functionality I can code myself.

#### Planned Features
1. Multi-Homes
2. Custom Fly
3. Custom Join Messages
4. Warp-Portals integration?
5. Modified combat
6. Custom Spawn Location
7. FirstJoin Equipment
8. UUID to Username tracking (If it's still a thing)
